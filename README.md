##What is CommuteOS
*Quoted from forum page*
For those of you who don't remember, or were not on the forums then, a few months ago marumaru (Now known as MechaTallon) began working on an operating system. It was to be a community project, where everyone could post their best code and it would be compiled into an Operating System. Unfortunately, the project was cancelled. Mecha and I have now decided to re-make CommuteOS, and start from scratch. Post your best code in the comments, or follow our progress in the Google Doc, IRC, or Github organization.
