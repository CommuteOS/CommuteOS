Hey guys, Dlcruz129 here, but my Git name is Typo-Kign (pronounced typo king, get it?). We're in-development right now, so unless you're a developer, GTFO! Who am I kidding, we're not in development right now, we haven't even started :P. Anyways, as soon as Mecha finishes up some other projects we'll get started. Kthxbai.
